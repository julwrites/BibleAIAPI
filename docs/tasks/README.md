# Task Documentation

This directory contains documentation for implementation tasks.

## Overview

The task documentation is organized into the following categories:

-   **`foundation/`**: Core architecture, project setup, and other foundational work.
-   **`features/`**: End-to-end feature implementations.
-   **`infrastructure/`**: Services, adapters, and other platform-level code.
-   **`testing/`**: Testing strategies and implementation tasks.

Each task document provides a record of the work, including the task's purpose, implementation details, and status.

## How to Use

-   **To understand a feature or component**: Find the relevant task document.
-   **When starting a new task**: Create a new task document in the appropriate category.
-   **Status Tracking**: Ensure the metadata at the top (Status) and bottom of the file matches the actual state.

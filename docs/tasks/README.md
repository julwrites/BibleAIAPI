# Task Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for implementation tasks, following the system outlined in the [Task Documentation System Guide](./GUIDE.md).

## Overview

The task documentation is organized into the following categories:

-   **`foundation/`**: Core architecture, project setup, and other foundational work.
-   **`features/`**: End-to-end feature implementations.
-   **`infrastructure/`**: Services, adapters, and other platform-level code.

Each task document provides a comprehensive record of the work, including the task's purpose, the decisions made during implementation, and the final outcome. This system is designed to provide context for developers and AI agents, ensuring that the history and evolution of the codebase are well-documented.

## How to Use

-   **To understand a feature or component**: Find the relevant task document in the appropriate category.
-   **When starting a new task**: Create a new task document using the template in the guide.
-   **During development**: Update the task document with your progress, decisions, and any blockers you encounter.
-   **When completing a task**: Mark the task as complete and fill in the `Actual Effort` and `Completed` fields.
